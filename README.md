At this writing we're utilizing the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com) to handle the responsive design inside React.

We'll stay as [vanilla as we can and use Bootstrap's button, card, etc](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/examples/) for those UI elements. Some customization may occur and will need a custom CSSâ€”"st.css" or some similar name.

We'll allow the native device to override the typeface to its default font, and [otherwise fall back to Helvetica Neue](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/content/reboot/#native-font-stack), as often shown in the Bootstrap wireframe examples.

For icons and controls we will use the [Material Icon Font](https://fonts.google.com/icons) wherever possible and only create custom SVGs in the rarest of instances.
