# **ServiTech Human Interface Guidelines**
*An attempt at standardization.*

To begin, we're utilizing the [Bootstrap framework](https://getbootstrap.com) to handle the responsive design inside React.

We're going to use the Material Design for the UI layer. It is a [package built for Bootstrap & React.] (https://mdbootstrap.com/docs/b5/react/
)

For icons and controls we will use the [Material Icon Font](https://fonts.google.com/icons) wherever possible and only create custom SVGs in the rarest of instances.
